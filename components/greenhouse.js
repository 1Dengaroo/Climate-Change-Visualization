        Greenhouse gases are gases that are found in Earth's atmosphere and
        are capable of trapping heat from the sun. These gases include
        carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and nitrous oxide. Greenhouse
        gases are essential for maintaining a habitable climate on Earth, as
        they help to regulate the temperature of the planet. However, human
        activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation,
        have significantly increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the
        atmosphere, leading to a phenomenon known as global warming. Global
        warming is the gradual increase in the overall temperature of
        Earth's atmosphere, which is caused by the increase in greenhouse
        gas concentrations. These higher levels of greenhouse gases trap
        more heat from the sun, causing the temperature of the planet to
        rise. This rise in temperature can have a variety of negative
        impacts on the environment, including more frequent heatwaves,
        droughts, and extreme weather events. It can also cause the melting
        of polar ice caps and the <strong>rise in sea levels</strong>.
