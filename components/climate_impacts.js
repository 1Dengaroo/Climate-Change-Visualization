      Human-driven climate change is causing sea levels to rise
    </h5>
    <div class="center">
      <p class="center">
        Global average sea level is increasing due to melting land ice and
        expansion of warming seawater, both caused by global warming. Sea
        level has been measured regularly since the 19th century using systems
        of coastal tide gauges. Over the past 100 years, global average sea
        level has risen about 7.5 inches. Now, satellites are used to measure
        sea level very precisely. Sea levels are rising more than twice as
        fast in recent decades than previously in the 20th century. Satellite
        data collected since 1993 show that global sea level has risen about
        3.8 inches in that time.

        This data contains “cumulative changes in sea level for the world’s
        oceans since 1880, based on a combination of long-term tide gauge
        measurements and recent satellite measurements. It shows average
        absolute sea level change, which refers to the height of the ocean
        surface, regardless of whether nearby land is rising or falling.

    <h5 class="center">Global Deforestation Rates</h5>
    <div class="center">
      <p class="center">
        An alarming percentage of the world's forests have already been
        removed to make room for our world's growing population. International
        statistics estimates that each year, 18 million acres of trees are
        clear-cut to make room for construction projects and the production of
        wood products; this represents just under half of all the trees that
        have been planted on the earth since the start of the industrial
        revolution. Trees are CO2 sponges, with the average tree absorbing more
        than 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year, so deforestation will only
        contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases. <br /><br />Hover
