        Human activity has had an effect on the environment for thousands of
        years, from the time of our very earliest ancestors. Since Homo
        sapiens first walked the earth, we have been modifying the
        environment around us through agriculture, travel and eventually
        through urbanization and commercial networks. At this point in
        earth’s physical history, our impact on the environment is so
        substantial that scientists believe “pristine nature,” or ecosystems
        untouched by human intervention, no longer exist.

      <p class="center intro-desc">
        Humans impact the physical environment in many ways: overpopulation,
        pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like
        these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality,
        and rising sea levels. These negative impacts can affect human
        behavior and can prompt mass migrations or battles over clean water.
